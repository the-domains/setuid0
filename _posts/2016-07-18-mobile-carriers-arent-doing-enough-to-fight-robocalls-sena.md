  Two US senators are urging the mobile phone industry to fight robocalls and
  texts by creating a database of phone numbers that have been reassigned from
  one customer to another. Reassigned numbers are one of the major contributors
  to unwanted calls and texts, and carriers haven't done enough to fight the
